# Neon Dance - Free Portfolio Website 😎🔥

### Hi everyone! I am happy to show you my first open source project on github.

It is created in the style of Neon Cyberpunk, (_was inspired by cyberpunk 2077_), in general I hope someone will like this project, and on its basis you can create something of your own.

> **Release will be soon, but you can use it right now😊**

### A little bit about myself

My name is Oleksii Vratskyi, and I am a freelancer from Ukraine, I am engaged in website development in different directions for several years, in this time I have managed to work with online stores, landing pages, blogs, etc.

Over the past couple of years as much as I can to learn, I have achieved what you see in this repository now, I was able to create SSR sites, not badly optimized too, I will continue to develop and learn, because this is what I live.

> By the way, I am now actively looking for a job, I would be happy to consider any options😇
